            <h4 id="TOP01"><a href="#TOP01" class="headerlink" title="TOP01"></a><em>TOP01</em></h4><h5 id="Speedo"><a href="#Speedo" class="headerlink" title="Speedo"></a>Speedo</h5><p>Australia<br><br><br>The 90-year-old Speedo is one of the first brands to produce and sell swimming equipment. It is also one of the best brands in the swimming equipment industry. Since the beginning of the brand, many swimmers have won the World Series in their Speedo gear. The leather high-tech swimsuit has helped Phelps achieve good results in the two Olympic Games in 2004 and 2008. The data shows that Speedo has a market share of more than 50% in the US competition-class swimsuit market.</p>
<p>Speedo has a fluid laboratory Aqua Lab, which specializes in the development and design of swimming equipment. The high-tech swimsuits such as shark skin and LZR are from this. In addition to swimwear, Sharkskin also launched the Fastskin series of goggles, which are aimed at professional swimmers. This series is the third generation of the Speedo high-end mirror Elite elite series, also known as the top in each brand of mirrors. The streamlined lens and frame design of this series of goggles can reduce the resistance in water, and the gasket fits tightly. No matter whether it is water or turning, it will not cause mirroring or water inflow. It is the swimming choice for world-class swimmers such as Sun Yang and McWay. mirror.</p>
<p>In addition, it is part of the shark skin system. The triangle on the mirror belt is the shark skin marking system, which is integrated with the shark skin swimsuit and swimming cap to help the user quickly find the wearing position.</p>
<p>The V-Class series won the 2017 Red Dot Design Award and is stylish. When Natalie Immanor swims in Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand Passion 8, he wears the full-field goggles. The gaskets of the V-Class series of goggles are applied with IQ-Fit technology for a light fit. This is Speedo‚Äôs first 3D gasket technology, based on the head data collected by its fluid laboratory, which effectively reduces the pressure on the eye caused by the gasket and the mirror belt, ensuring the seal and not leaving it in the eye. Underdentation, suitable for ladies who love beauty. But the V-Class series is also selling at a high price, suitable for consumers with ample budget.</p>
<p>The Biofuse series of goggles are more suitable for ordinary swimmers, relatively cheap. The series of goggles are equipped with large frames, comfortable for swimming and comfortable, and the gaskets are based on Biofuse technology. This is Speedo‚Äôs unique technology in goggles. It is based on a huge database of Asian head scans and uses thermoplastic elastomers. (TPR) is made into a 3D gasket that fits the contour of the eye socket to prevent water seepage during swimming. Although the Biofuse series uses an integrated nose bridge, the application of Biofuse technology also makes the nose bridge and frame soft and flexible.</p>
<p>Consumers who prefer a replaceable nose bridge can choose the Aquapure series, which is slightly cheaper than the Biofuse series. It is basically equipped with 3 replaceable nose bridges. Users can choose the size that suits them best according to their face type. The adjustment belt is convenient for adjusting and positioning the length of the mirror belt, which is more suitable for beginners. It is recommended that the novice choose a transparent lens when selecting the goggles, so that it can be clearly viewed under water to avoid the fear caused by the invisible.</p>
<p>In addition to adult goggles, Speedo also introduced children‚Äôs goggles, which are divided into two stages, ages 2-6 and 6-14, and the age is not detailed enough. Ocean Q team series is suitable for children aged 2-6, integrated large frame, bright color, full of childlike fun; Mariner Supreme is suitable for friends aged 6-14, with adjustable nose bridge, according to eye distance, nose bridge Make adjustments.</p>

<h4 id="TOP02"><a href="#TOP02" class="headerlink" title="TOP02"></a><em>TOP02</em></h4><h5 id="Arena"><a href="#Arena" class="headerlink" title="Arena"></a>Arena</h5><p>France<br><br><br>Arena can be said to be Speedo‚Äôs number one competitor, and Speedo is the top swimming arena. Arena was first established by Adidas France, and in the third year of the market, players wearing Arena swimsuits won 27 gold medals at the Montreal Olympics. In the 200m freestyle swimming at the 2009 World Swimming Championships in Rome, Phelps, wearing the fourth generation of shark skin, lost to the German athlete Paul Biederman wearing the Arena Polyurethane X-Glide swimsuit in 1 second.</p>
<p>Cobra Ultra is Arena‚Äôs latest series of mirrors. It is different from the design of the mirror frame of the general goggles. The temples are integrated with the frame and extend from both ends of the frame. The rear end is connected with a double-layer mirror to enhance the goggles. stability. In addition, although the frame lens is smaller than the leisure goggles, the curvature of the edge of the lens allows it to have a wide side view, and the surrounding environment can be easily observed in the water. This series of goggles offers 5 sizes of replaceable nose bridge.<br>The mirror frame is small and tightly wrapped around the eye socket to reduce the resistance in the water, so the wearing comfort is not high. Arena E-commerce sells fewer mirrors. If it is just a daily swimming exercise, it is recommended to choose a larger frame. Swimming goggles. Arena‚Äôs casual goggles are both professional and practical. The goggles with a replaceable nose bridge are better. The swimmer can choose the right size nasal bridge according to his or her eye contour.</p>
<p>AGY-340 and AGG-280M are large frame leisure goggles, and both models can replace the nose bridge. The AGG-280M also has 4 size nose bridges, which are more targeted. It is best for the beginner to purchase the goggles first. Try to wear the frame around the eyelids without wearing the lens. Test the fit and absorbency of the goggles. If you can feel the suction of the gasket, it will prove. This goggle has a high degree of fit and good sealing, and it is not easy to enter the water when swimming.</p>
<p>The M on the Arena goggle model indicates that the goggles use coated lenses. The goggles with coated lenses look cool, and the lenses block glare. Even if you swim in the beach during the day, you won‚Äôt be blinded by the sun, ensuring clear vision and suitable for open water with strong light. However, this coated lens goggles will be difficult to see clearly in the dark water. If you plan to use it in low-light areas such as indoor swimming pools, it is recommended to choose colored transparent lenses, especially colorless transparent and yellow lenses. The lens color can be selected according to your swimming place.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP03"><a href="#TOP03" class="headerlink" title="TOP03"></a><em>TOP03</em></h4><h5 id="Aqua-Sphere"><a href="#Aqua-Sphere" class="headerlink" title="Aqua Sphere"></a>Aqua Sphere</h5><p>Italy<br><br><br>Founded in 1998, Aqua Sphere has become a newcomer to the swimming equipment industry in a short period of time with its unique and creative product design. After returning from Phelps, he gave up Speedo, who has been sponsoring him, and cooperated with Aqua Sphere. It is enough to see its brand strength.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the brand, Aqua Sphere was dedicated to the development of more comfortable goggles. The large frame, large lens and full field of view are the hallmarks of the Aqua Sphere goggles. In the goggles production, Aqua Sphere has a number of patented technology, its Plexisol curved lens can provide 180 degrees of distortion-free vision, Softeril gasket is tight and skin-friendly. In addition, the Aqua Sphere‚Äôs goggles are produced in Italy.</p>
<p>The Kayenne series of adult and adolescent goggles with Plexisol lenses are rated by Best Wire Goggles as the best goggles, and the quick-adjustable button closure makes it easy to adjust even when wearing goggles. The coated lens mainly blocks the glare on the water, anti-glare, and the metallic coating looks cool. The polarized lens not only blocks the glare, but also filters out the surface reflection. For swimmers who often swim in open waters, it is more practical.</p>
<p>Following the best-selling Kaiman series, Aqua Sphere introduced the Kaiman EXO, which uses EXO Core technology and is made from two composite materials to better protect lenses and extend their lifespan compared to Kaiman‚Äôs frames. The Kaiman EXO series is slightly cheaper than the Kayenne series.</p>
<p>The Aqua Sphere goggles feature an integrated frame, and the nose bridges are non-replaceable or adjustable, but in addition to the fixed size, each series is available in Small Fit and Women‚Äôs models for small faces. Due to the fixed size, consumers are advised to try on it before purchasing to determine the fit of the goggles.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP04"><a href="#TOP04" class="headerlink" title="TOP04"></a><em>TOP04</em></h4><h5 id="Tabata-VIEW"><a href="#Tabata-VIEW" class="headerlink" title="Tabata VIEW"></a>Tabata VIEW</h5><p>Japan<br><br><br>VIEW is a professional goggle brand under the Japanese Tabata Rubber Co., Ltd., which has launched the world‚Äôs first interchangeable lens with a degree of goggles, and currently has the highest share in the Japanese goggles market. Because it is a Japanese brand, VIEW‚Äôs goggles are mainly designed for Asian face and eye contours. They have high fit, strong sealing and are not easy to seep.</p>
<p>The Blade series is the main racing goggle for VIEW. The shape of the series of lenses and frames is mainly designed to reduce the projected area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe eye cup and reduce the resistance. In 2004, the initial Blade‚Äôs resistance in water was 47% lower than that of the same size goggles, and the upgraded Blade Zero series went one step further, reducing the resistance area by 5% compared to the traditional Blade. Blade Zero‚Äôs mirror belt adopts a V-shaped structure, and the upper and lower parts of the mirror belt are respectively fixed on the frame, so that the mirror surface is more conformable to the face and enhances stability.</p>
<p>In addition to Blade, VIEW‚Äôs ladies goggles and children‚Äôs mirrors are also core products. The goggles are generally unisex, and many brands of women‚Äôs goggles are only slightly adjusted in the color and size of the frame, and VIEW can be said to be the first brand to design goggles for women. The women‚Äôs series VIEW FRAU is softly designed to fit the female aesthetic, and the gasket will not leave marks on the face after use.</p>
<p>VIEW‚Äôs children‚Äôs mirror is divided into three-stage kindergarten children aged 3-5, 4-9 years old, and 6-12 years old. The degree of subdivision is higher than that of the general brand. Children of all ages can purchase the right size goggles, but The overall appearance is similar to that of adult leisure goggles, mostly solid colors, no cartoon designs. In addition, the washers of most children‚Äôs goggles of VIEW have antibacterial function certified by Japan‚Äôs SIAA, but they should be cleaned after swimming.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP05"><a href="#TOP05" class="headerlink" title="TOP05"></a><em>TOP05</em></h4><h5 id="ZOGGS"><a href="#ZOGGS" class="headerlink" title="ZOGGS"></a>ZOGGS</h5><p>Australia<br><br><br>Like Speedo, ZOOGS originated in Australia, but Speedo‚Äôs core is in swimwear, and ZOOGS‚Äôs fist product is casual goggles. ZOGGS has a number of ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù in the field of goggles: the earliest introduction of UV protective goggles, integrated goggles, the earliest design of goggles for children under 6 years old. However, in terms of the comprehensive degree of goggle products, the professionalism of the mirror, the diversity of materials, etc., ZOOGS has a certain gap with Speedo.</p>
<p>ZOGGS is also the first brand to apply optical color-changing lenses to swimming goggles. This lens is dark when the light is strong, and becomes transparent when the light is dim. At present, there are not many brands of goggles using optical color-changing lenses. British swimmer Adam Walker used this kind of color-changing lens when wearing the ZOOGS Predator Flex Titanium Reactor from Ireland when crossing Scotland. For amateur swimmers who are not professional players, the daily practicality of this series of goggles is not strong, so the recommendation is not high.</p>
<p>The main goggles of ZOOGS also have a number of patented technologies in the field of goggles: in terms of lenses, the CLT curved lens provides a 180¬∞ full-angle view; Air Cushion air washers provide a custom fit and are not easy on the face. Leave a mark; Ultra Fit washers are 15% lighter than regular washers. The 319755 leisure goggles use air washers, which are comfortable to use and suitable for beginners. The price is considerable.</p>
<p>Compared with the casual mirror, ZOOGS‚Äôs children and juvenile models are superior. Some models have cartoon patterns on the mirrors, which make them easier for children to enjoy and accept. The stretchable mirror straps are also convenient for children to adjust. ZOGGS children‚Äôs goggles are generally divided into two stages of 6 years old and 6-14 years old. The phantom mask series can meet the needs of children in these two stages. It is equipped with an oversized integrated frame and the brand‚Äôs unique soft seal soft washer. Comfortable, but the children‚Äôs mirrors of ZOOGS are fixed nasal bridges. It is best to try them before you buy them, so as to prevent the swimming goggles from fitting enough to cause water.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP06"><a href="#TOP06" class="headerlink" title="TOP06"></a><em>TOP06</em></h4><h5 id="TYR"><a href="#TYR" class="headerlink" title="TYR"></a>TYR</h5><p>United States<br><br><br>The name TYR originated from the god of the Nordic warrior Tyr. One of the founders was Steve Furniss, the captain of the 1976 US Olympic swimming team. He won the bronze medal at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The other founder is TYR. Some, swimming equipment designer Joseph DiLorenzo.</p>
<p>Like many swimming equipment brands, TYR is dominated by swimwear and competes with Speedo in the US-class swimwear market, but its share is not as good as Speedo. TYR‚Äôs goggles are very diverse and it is one of the few brands to use photochromic lenses. The Special Ops 3.0 Transition goggles are equipped with this lens, designed for versatile projects and open water swimmers. It is about $40.</p>
<p>TYR‚Äôs products are mostly professional mirrors. The Tracer-X and Blackhawk series are certified by FINA FINA, and the Tracer-X series of goggles have a range of 206¬∞. The underwater field of view is wider than other brands. In order to reduce the underwater resistance, the racing goggles have a small frame and are not suitable for daily swimming.</p>
<p>Although positioned as a professional racing goggles, the Nest Pro series TPR gaskets are highly sealed and comfortable, and are also suitable for skilled swimmers to swim leisurely. The series of frames are designed with inspiration from the Bird‚Äôs Nest Stadium at the Beijing Olympics. The interwoven frame structure on the frame enhances the support and stability of the frame and costs about $20.</p>
<p>The Swimple series is the first children‚Äôs goggles sold by TYR. It uses Durafit silicone washers, which are soft and durable. The frame can be selected from frogs, starfishes and spiders. It is quite childlike. Unfortunately, the integrated frame cannot be adjusted. . In addition to the special children‚Äôs mirror series, other series of goggles are also available in ladies and teenagers.<br><br><br>
