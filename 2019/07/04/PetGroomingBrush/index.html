            <h4 id="TOP01"><a href="#TOP01" class="headerlink" title="TOP01"></a><em>TOP01</em></h4><h5 id="Christensen"><a href="#Christensen" class="headerlink" title="Christensen"></a>Christensen</h5><p>United States  </p>
<p>Christensen is a professional pet grooming brand, mainly engaged in pet combs and pet shampoos. The comb is dominated by row combs, needle combs and handle combs, each of which is hand made by a German worker. The comb is made of beech and carbon steel and is basically free of static electricity, making it ideal for pets.</p>
<p>The famous permanent needle comb, known as ‚Äúevery cat must have a comb.‚Äù The eucalyptus comb has a smooth line and a comfortable grip. The air cushion is made of rubber, which is very soft and has a fast rebound speed. The needle is manually inserted into the brass hole of the air cushion. The needle tip is rounder than most other brand needles, and the friction on the skin is small and does not cause pain. The needle comb is most suitable for dogs and cats with double-layered hair. It is very suitable for cleaning the fluff. The comb is large, but the effect of cleaning the needle is general.</p>
<p>There are several models for permanent needle combs. The most classic square combs are Mark I/II/III in three sizes, MARK VIII is a round needle comb, and MARK VI/VII is a curved needle comb. The sense of use of different styles of needle combs is not much different, mainly depending on personal preferences. The needle comb is also available in black and red versions. It is painted on the logs and is more slip resistant than the regular version. The price is slightly higher. Because it is handmade, the comb will occasionally have flaws, some of the combs will have glue or the edge gap is too large, generally does not affect the use.</p>
<p>Christensen‚Äôs needle comb has less hair, but cleaning is more troublesome. When cleaning, first remove the hair on the comb by hand, and then use a small brush to clean back and forth from both ends of the comb until all the fine hair is removed. If washing, be careful to avoid water flowing into the small hole of the comb.</p>
<p>Because it will damage the air cushion, the needle comb can not be used with the essential oil. If you want to match the hair oil, you can choose the No. 000 comb. 000 is the most classic and basic comb of Christensen. It has a good feel and a moderate weight. The comb combs are evenly rounded, the wide tooth side is suitable for combing the knots, and the fine teeth are used for combing. The size of the 006 row comb is much smaller than the 000 number and is suitable for grooming the face and foot hair. However, if your pet is well-behaved, the No. 000 comb is also capable of combing the details, without the need to purchase additional combs.</p>
<p>The handle comb is a good helper for pets, and Christensen‚Äôs handle comb is especially comfortable. Its gold round handle comb is made of copper alloy, which is wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant. The conductive performance is better than that of most of the handle comb locks. The carding is basically free of static electricity. The comb handle is made of beech, medium hardness, and bright after the black paint. The comb is much thicker than the needle comb, and the tip is more rounded. Although the gold comb has less combing hair than the needle comb, the massage function is even better, which is very suitable for long hair pets and massage, and the cleaning method is similar to the needle comb.<br>Christensen‚Äôs mane comb has a full pig, a nylon pig, and a copper pig bristle brush. Nylon bristle is suitable for long-haired pets with double or curly hair. Nylon needles can be inserted into thick layers of hair to help open the knot and allow the piglets to come into contact with the skin. The copper wire bristle and the whole pig scorpion are suitable for medium and short-haired pets, which can absorb dust, can not absorb static electricity, and have excellent hair-splitting effect.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP02"><a href="#TOP02" class="headerlink" title="TOP02"></a><em>TOP02</em></h4><h5 id="Philocomb"><a href="#Philocomb" class="headerlink" title="Philocomb"></a>Philocomb</h5><p>Japan  </p>
<p>Philocomb is designed and manufactured by Diatolib and is headquartered in Aichi, Japan. Pet owners may be more familiar with the name of the shell comb than Philocomb. The shell comb is the only comb of Philocomb, named after the shell. Since the introduction of the shell comb, the reason why the pet industry has been popular for many years is its wide acceptance and good sense of use.</p>
<p>The shell comb has only one row of plastic combs, S-shaped, and the tip of the tooth is semi-circular, avoiding the sharp teeth from directly crossing the pet‚Äôs skin. The comb teeth are elastic, and when the knotted hair is bounced, it avoids pulling the hair, so the comfort is relatively high. Therefore, the shell comb is more suitable for cleaning the hair instead of opening the knot. If the pet hair is knotted more, it is recommended to comb it with a row of combs or a needle comb.</p>
<p>The shell comb has a dense comb and a large amount of combing. It can comb the pet‚Äôs fluff and can also comb some of the needle hair. Since the comb teeth are relatively long, the hair under the comb will be caught at the bottom of the comb, and the hair is not flying, and the cleaning is also convenient. The shell comb has a shell-shaped grip made of ABS plastic, which is not only good-looking, but also very light and easy.</p>
<p>There are three models of shell combs. The teeth of E1 are purple soft teeth, which are suitable for combing soft animals such as cats and rabbits. E3 is an orange long comb with a larger curvature and is suitable for long-haired pets. The comb of E2 is harder than the other two models, and the combing volume is the largest. It is recommended for dogs and cats in the hair-changing period. If it is a sensitive skin and cat, it is recommended to choose E1 or E3 combs, prefer to comb more times to avoid hurting the pet‚Äôs skin.</p>
<p>The comb of the shell comb can be tested for 150,000 times without breaking, and normal use for two or three years is not a problem. However, the specific service life of the shell comb has a great relationship with the way of use. The shell comb can only be combed in the direction of the comb teeth, and the reverse comb combs the comb teeth seriously, which will reduce the service life. In addition, because it is a plastic product, it is easy to be bitten, so remember to collect it when not in use, so as not to be smashed by a pet as a toy.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP03"><a href="#TOP03" class="headerlink" title="TOP03"></a><em>TOP03</em></h4><h5 id="FURminator"><a href="#FURminator" class="headerlink" title="FURminator"></a>FURminator</h5><p>United States  </p>
<p>The Spectrum Group is a Fortune 500 listed company with over 100 years of history. FURminator is the group‚Äôs leading brand of pet care products. Fumanite‚Äôs products provide a full range of hair care services for pets. The full line of products includes bristles, hair combs and hair cleansing products.</p>
<p>Fumanette‚Äôs mane comb is the most sought after and is suitable for double-layered pets, claiming to reduce hair loss by 90%. The coat of a double-layered pet is composed of thick outer long hairs and soft inner thick fluff. British short cats, huskies and other pets are double-layered, while Siamese cats and poodles are single-layered coats. Single-layered hair pets have little hair loss, while double-layered hair pets lose hair for a long time, especially when changing the hair season, the inner layer of fluff will fall off a lot.</p>
<p>The comb of the bristles is made of stainless steel, and the edges and tips of the comb teeth are smoothed, and the underlying waste hair can be combed through the needles, and the partially detached needles are brought down to reduce the amount of hair loss during the changing season. However, while combing a large amount of fluff, the blade will also bring some healthy hair, so avoid repeating the same part, and do not use it at high frequency. It is recommended to use it once a week.</p>
<p>The Fumanite comb is very detailed according to the pet breed, size and length of hair. The average comb has a relatively small amount of hair, which will fly in use and needs to be cleaned up repeatedly. For this reason, Fumeinet designed an automatic cleaning button. Although it is not completely cleaned, it is convenient to empty the comb during the carding process. Although the size of the comb comb for short-haired and long-haired pets is the same, the length of the comb is different. Short-haired models have shorter comb teeth and are more flying than long-haired models.</p>
<p>In addition to the mane comb, Fumeinet also has combs such as combs, combs, massage combs, as well as nail clippers and nail polishers. Fumanette‚Äôs combs are gifted with a protective shell that protects the combs and is a more detailed one in the comb brand. However, there is a problem with the quality control of the protective cover.</p>
<p>Fumanette‚Äôs pet manual nail scissors are scissors-type, and the handles are made of TPR rubber for a comfortable feel. The nail clipper has a front stop and an adjustment knob to prevent the cut from being cut too long to the blood line.</p>
<p>If you are worried about cutting your pet‚Äôs blood line, you can also try using an electric nail polisher. The electric nail polisher drives the grindstone cutter head through the motor, grinding the nails bit by bit, and it is not easy to hurt the blood line, and the safety is better. However, the nail polisher has a certain amount of noise, and it takes a long time, and there is a burnt smell in the nail grinding process.</p>
<p>Fumenette‚Äôs nail polisher uses a dry battery with a plastic cover to prevent nail splashes and LED lights for easy observation during nailing. The official recommendation is to use it two or three times a week. After use, wipe it with a rag to prevent the nails from affecting the nail polish.<br><br><br>

<p>Japan Dogeman Co., Ltd. was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in Osaka, Japan. In 2006, Japan‚Äôs Dougman increased its capital and registered capital reached 1,067,784,750 yen. In addition to local companies, Duoge has production plants and trading companies in Shanghai. At present, the company is mainly engaged in pet snacks and pet supplies. Combs, scissors and nail clippers are involved in the combing tools. The style of the products is lovely and warm. In order to adapt to the cute style, the comb cutting tool is also small overall, the grip is not particularly comfortable, suitable for small hands, the product is also suitable for cats and small and medium dogs.</p>
<p>There are four series of multi-gravity combing tools, Cattysalon is pink and white, and Doggysalon is blue and white. The two series of products correspond one-to-one, except for the shape and color, and the material and feel of the yellow Honey Smile series are similar. Another series of HomeBeauty uses a wooden comb handle for a more comfortable grip.</p>
<p>The overall shape of the Cattysalon and Doggysalon series of corner combs mimics cats and dogs, the comb part is the shape of the head and the comb part is the tail. The comb is similar to the Philocomb, S-shaped, made of PC, harder than Philocomb. Although the amount of combing is not as good as Philocomb, the performance is also calculated, and it is not very flying. The corner comb is much cheaper than the Philocomb, but the comb is smaller and only suitable for small pets. The same series of card clothing combs and corner combs are similar, the comb teeth are also very similar, but the flying hair is serious, the use is not as good as the corner comb.</p>
<p>The Cattysalon and Doggysalon collections also sell combed mittens, which are similar to the popular ‚Äúbristle gloves‚Äù, but the multi-glove gloves are pointed and more flexible. The combing gloves are very cute, and the palms are in the EVA material, which is made into the pattern of cat claws and dog claws. The amount of combing is not large, suitable for pets with medium and short hair.</p>
<p>HomeBeauty‚Äôs wooden handles have a medium comb and a comfortable grip. The comb teeth are made of stainless steel, the tip of the needle is sharp, and care should be taken not to comb too deep when combing. For combing newbies, you can try the Honeybeauty series of needle-punch brushes. The combs have a round head and a row without a belt. They can avoid scratching while combing. However, the material of the round head is resin, which is easy to fall off and may be pinched. Needle combs and handle combs are more difficult to clean, and many grids will present a small comb for cleaning, which is very intimate.</p>
<p>Each of the series has a scissor-style nail clipper. Homebeauty‚Äôs largest size is suitable for large dogs. The cutter head is sharp and smooth, the handle has a spring, and the armor automatically rebounds after being cut for easy operation. Other sizes of Homebeauty and other series of nail clippers are suitable for small and medium-sized pets. They are all designed with corners to make it easier to avoid pets. The HoneySimle collection also has a nail clipper set with a sickle and sickle-shaped nail clipper. The sickle-type nail clipper cuts the nail by pushing the blade. The knife head cover has a nail box, and the cut nails do not splash and are easy to clean.<br>  <br><br></p>
<h4 id="TOP05"><a href="#TOP05" class="headerlink" title="TOP05"></a><em>TOP05</em></h4><h5 id="Petio"><a href="#Petio" class="headerlink" title="Petio"></a>Petio</h5><p>Japan  </p>
<p>Established in 1986, Yamahisa‚Äôs brand Petio has enjoyed a leading market position in pet toys, snacks, care products and pet apparel for decades. It is also a household name in Japan. Petio and the cat backyard collaborated to launch a series of toys and costumes that restored the props in the game, with exquisite detail and superior quality.<br>Petio‚Äôs combing tool style is similar to that of the multi-grid. It is a cute Japanese style, and the price is generally higher than that of the multi-grid. Petio‚Äôs combing tools mainly include the Preciante series and the necoco series. The Preciante series is cherry pink, full of young girls. The products are common for dogs and cats, and the size is relatively small, which is more suitable for small and medium-sized pets. The necoco series is specially designed for cats, and the colors are mainly coffee.</p>
<p>Petio‚Äôs comb has the most combs. The PR series of automatic cleaning cats use a needle comb to push the push plate at the bottom of the comb to push the hair on the comb teeth for easy cleaning. The push plate pushes smoothly, the comb comb is softer, and the comb has a small amount of combing. The needle comb is divided into long hair and short hair. The short hair needle has a round plastic wrap. Don‚Äôt worry about grinding the pet. The long hair does not have a plastic head so that the comb teeth can be inserted better without pulling the hair.</p>
<p>Petio‚Äôs flea combs are uniquely designed to be combed to fleas and scorpions that are received in a transparent box to prevent escape. It is recommended to prepare a pot of soapy water when combing the fleas. After combing the fleas and tweezers, you can remove the box and put it into the water immediately, so that the insects will suffocate and die.</p>
<p>The price of Petio nail scissors is higher than that of many, and it has a long service life. It has been as sharp as a few years. Electric nail polishers are smaller than most brands of nail polishers and are suitable for cats or small dogs. However, the efficiency is relatively low, and it is more suitable for smoothing the nails after nail cutting.<br><br><br>

<p>Since its founding in 1961, Petmate has expanded its product line from pet air box to pet eating and drinking. The product involves 11 pet categories and has over 100 product design patents. It has JW and FAT. More than 10 pet products such as CAT and ASPEN are sold throughout the United States and around the world. As a ‚ÄúP&amp;G in the pet supplies industry,‚Äù Petmate certainly did not miss the combing tools.</p>
<p>Petmate has a complete range of combs, combs, needles and massage combs.</p>
<p>Petmate pet massage bath comb is a special design, it is glove-like, similar to ‚Äúcat gloves‚Äù, but Petmate‚Äôs function is more abundant, in addition to daily massage comb can also be used when taking a bath. The side of the bath comb is a rubber comb surface, and the other side is a special cloth to stick the hair, and the amount of lower hair is medium. Gloves are relatively large in size, and girls with small hands may not be able to use them.</p>
<p>Petmate‚Äôs bristle comb is actually a knotted comb that cuts the knotted hair and has some damage to the pet‚Äôs hair. And there are user feedback blades that are not sharp enough to be easy to pull. In contrast, the 2-in-1 double-sided massage comb is more recommended, with a stainless steel needle comb on one side for opening and cleaning the hair, and a bristle comb on one side, which can be used to brush off the dust and make the hair more fluffy. The material of the slightly squeaky comb is nylon.</p>
<p>Petmate stainless steel combs can also be used for opening knots, and the denser side of the comb can also be used to comb the details. The comb combs are free to rotate to avoid pulling the hair during combing. The handle is made of rubber and is comfortable to slip.</p>
<p>In addition to the conventional scissors, Petmate‚Äôs nail scissors also have a sickle-type nail clipper that plugs the pet‚Äôs nail into the hole of the nail clipper and cuts the nail by pushing the blade. Compared with scissors-type nail clippers, these nail clippers are more labor-saving and are suitable for novice pets and people with less strength. Petmate‚Äôs electric nail polisher is designed for dogs. It can be adjusted in four steps. It comes with a replaceable grindstone. It is more cost-effective than the FURminator.<br><br><br>

<p>Since the first product was launched in 1976, KONG has been committed to providing quality pet toys and snacks. Now KONG products are sold in 80 countries and regions, and its original rubber dog toys are even more famous. More than that, the KONG Zoom Groomer massage comb is also well received.</p>
<p>KONG‚Äôs massage comb is made of natural rubber, soft and not tied, and the pet is more accepted. In addition to being a massage comb for bathing, it is also very suitable as a daily combing product. The comb of the massage comb can carry a large amount of needle hair, and is one of the few combs that are very suitable for combing the needle hair. There is static electricity when dry combing, but it does not affect the effect of cleaning the hair. If it is used in winter, you can spray a pet anti-static spray to enhance the bulkiness and uniformity of the hair.</p>
<p>The massage comb is easy to clean, the hair can be removed by hand, or it can be washed, but the disadvantage is that because the comb teeth are sparse, the hair is not able to be caught, the hair is relatively flying, and the hair under the comb will remain on the pet and needs to be reused. Hand down. The condition of the flying hair can be improved by the combing technique. When the hair is combed, it is combed down along the back of the pet, and when it is combed to the tail, it is pressed down, so that the hair will be concentrated in the tail and the flying hair can be reduced.</p>
<p>The massage comb is divided into cat models and dog models, each with pink and blue, the difference is mainly in the pattern, the effect is the same. The difference between a pet and a young pet is the size of the comb. All hair pets can be used.<br><br><br>

At the end of 2017, Wataoka launched a cat tongue comb in conjunction with GK, Japan‚Äôs largest comprehensive design agency, and won the G-mark Excellence Design Award from Japan, the only award in Japan for the overall evaluation of the overall design quality.</p>
<p>The cat‚Äôs tongue comb is flat, the lines are smooth, the tooth pitch is even, the comb surface imitates the cat‚Äôs tongue barb, and the cat feels the cat‚Äôs own bristles when combed. The amount of combing is small and it is more suitable for massage. The ends of the cat‚Äôs tongue are designed to have different oval shapes. The wider end is used to comb the cat‚Äôs abdomen and the inside of the hands and feet. The narrower side is used to comb the cat‚Äôs head, face and chin. In addition to cats, short-haired dogs can also be used. However, the cat tongue comb is not suitable for long-haired pets, because the comb teeth are short and can not touch the skin, and can not function as a massage.</p>
<p>The cat tongue comb is made of plastic. After use, it can be cleaned with water. Because the heat resistance temperature is 80 ¬∞C, it can‚Äôt be disinfected with boiling water. The cat‚Äôs tongue is available in gray-blue and pink, with a beautiful box and a good choice as a gift.<br><br><br>
