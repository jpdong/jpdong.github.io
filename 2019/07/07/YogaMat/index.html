            <h4 id="TOP01"><a href="#TOP01" class="headerlink" title="TOP01"></a><em>TOP01</em></h4><h5 id="Manduka"><a href="#Manduka" class="headerlink" title="Manduka"></a>Manduka</h5><p>United States</p>
<p>Manduka yoga mats are divided into PVC and natural rubber. It is well known that natural rubber has good environmental protection and strong anti-slip performance, but Manduka‚Äôs PVC yoga mat not only has excellent elasticity and cushioning performance, but also environmental protection and anti-slip performance. Natural rubber, the representative of which is Black Mat PRO, has been known as ‚Äúthe best yoga mat in the world‚Äù for ten years.</p>
<p>The high-profile legendary black mat belongs to the PRO series, and the PRO Lite series is made in Germany and has passed Oeko-Tex certification, ensuring environmental protection and safety. Both use top-grade 1.4g/cm3 high-density PVC material, which has better cushioning power than ordinary PVC, effectively protecting the spine, buttocks, knees and elbows. Surface closed-cell structure, anti-slip and non-adhesive, excellent anti-wear performance. According to official data, ordinary yoga practitioners can use 10,000 times. Even for the Ashtanga practitioners who have extremely high durability, Manduka can satisfy Its use requirements.</p>
<p>The PRO series is heavy and inconvenient to carry, while the PRO Lite is thinner and lighter than the PRO. The new mat has a thin antibacterial film on the surface. When it is used for the first time, it will feel insufficient anti-slip performance. It can be scraped with a cleaning agent to shorten the running-in period. Manduka is almost the only brand on the market that offers a lifetime warranty, but is limited to these two collections, which is why black pads are highly regarded.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two classic series, Manduka designs different series of products for different consumer groups. The Manduka X series and the welcOMe series are the same as the PRO series, all of which are made of high-density PVC. The Manduka X series is designed for professional athletes. The welcOMe series is suitable for beginners. The eKO series, eKO Lite series and eKO Superlite series are three-layer natural rubber material, which is softer than PRO and more suitable for yoga. The eKO Superlite series is the lightest and thinnest product of Manduka. It is foldable and convenient for travel. . The eQua Hot series and GRP series are prepared for high temperature yoga. The surface is open-hole structure, which absorbs moisture and absorbs sweat. It is more resistant to wet and slippery, but its durability is relatively average.</p>
<p>Since domestic technology and standards cannot meet the requirements, Manduka has not set up factories in China, but there are specialized agencies in China, and e-commerce platforms also have authorized stores. It is worth noting that the domestic ‚Äúfrog‚Äù is a counterfeit brand. The products sold are not Manduka‚Äôs products. The price is low and the quality cannot be compared.<br><br><br>

<p>Lululemon is a household name in the North American market. People are proud of owning the Lululemon shopping bag. Since its establishment in 1998 and its listing in 2007, lululemon has been a young brand in the yoga industry, but in just a few years, it has become the first professional sport in Canada.

<p>In terms of yoga mats, Lululemon uses a blend of natural rubber. The main feature is that both sides are available, the utilization rate is higher, the surface polyurethane layer absorbs moisture and slips, and it is suitable for sweaty yoga faction, the bottom layer of textured rubber layer, scratching Strong ground strength, suitable for static yoga with less sweating. Some products add latex cushion in the middle to effectively protect the buttocks and knees. Double-sided yoga mat 5mm, double-sided yoga mat 3mm and (Un) Mat are three new products in 2018. The selling point is to add antibacterial agent to the surface to prevent mold and mold growth. Those who are too lazy to maintain may wish to try these models.</p>
<p>For more portable products, consider The Reversible (Un) yoga mats and travel business yoga mats, both of which are 1.5mm thick, lightweight and foldable, and can be used on other mats to increase slip resistance. The Reversible (Un) yoga mat is a single-sided yoga mat.<br>  <br><br></p>
<h4 id="TOP03"><a href="#TOP03" class="headerlink" title="TOP03"></a><em>TOP03</em></h4><h5 id="Jade-Yoga"><a href="#Jade-Yoga" class="headerlink" title="Jade Yoga"></a>Jade Yoga</h5><p>United States<br>Jade Yoga is definitely a professional brand in the yoga mat world. It originated in the 1970s and was formerly known as Jade Industries. It started with the production of non-slip eco-friendly carpets. Because of its good anti-slip and environmental protection, the carpet is often used as a yoga mat. Jade Yoga will launch the Harmony series of professional products, and the market will receive a good response. This is the first natural rubber mat in the US market. . The natural rubber yoga mat is also recognized as the ‚Äúfirst green yoga mat‚Äù by the US Environmental Protection Law because of its natural environmental protection and recyclability.</p>
<p>Jade Yoga is the representative of the high-end yoga mat brand. The raw materials and production lines are all in the United States. Its products are mainly made of natural rubber and have a special manufacturing process. Compared with the ‚Äúblack mat‚Äù, the comfort and resilience are better, but natural rubber. Easy to biodegrade, easy to change color, and less durable.</p>
<p>Jade Yoga‚Äôs products are not many styles. The classic Harmony PRO series has the highest sales volume and 4.8mm thickness, which is the first choice for advanced players and yoga instructors. The Travel series and Voyager series are relatively thinner and lighter, suitable for travel. The Voyager series can be folded, but it is easy to wrinkle after folding, and it is not beautiful when used. The Fusion series is almost the thickest natural rubber mat on the market, reaching 7.9mm, which is more cushioning and suitable for beginners. Elite S‚Äôs top layer uses denser fibers to increase its durability and is the most durable in the Jade Yoga line.</p>
<p>As a representative of natural rubber yoga mats, Jade Yoga is relatively moderate in terms of price, and it is much more affordable than some ‚Äúlocal tyrants‚Äù, but unfortunately domestic purchases are inconvenient and require Haitao or purchasing.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="TOP04"><a href="#TOP04" class="headerlink" title="TOP04"></a><em>TOP04</em></h4><h5 id="Liforme"><a href="#Liforme" class="headerlink" title="Liforme"></a>Liforme</h5><p>United Kingdom  </p>
<p>Liforme claims to be the world‚Äôs first brand to introduce a positional guideline yoga mat, but in fact it has been developing in the yoga mat industry for less than ten years, and it is still late than the old domestic yoga products such as Yuanyang and Jade Bird. Liforme yoga mats are available in more than 30 countries around the world. The main selling point is that the AlignForMe system developed by the company can avoid the damage caused by non-standard movements and is widely recognized by consumers.</p>
<p>Liforme specializes in yoga mats, but there are only a few styles, only 7 models, all using natural rubber base and soft and elastic felt layer, natural rubber content of 90%. Natural rubber is the most environmentally friendly material on the market. It has better slip resistance than PVC and NBR materials, and is softer and more comfortable.

<p>Decathlon began in France in 1976, positioning the mass sports market and is known worldwide for its low price and good quality. In 2003, Decathlon officially entered the Chinese market. Currently, it has been stationed in more than 60 cities in China, with 166 offline stores. The online shopping mall has been very convenient since 2009.</p>
<p>Decathlon yoga mat is mainly made of PVC material, and the word of mouth is not bad. In terms of thickness, the yoga mat of 4-8mm thickness has moderate softness, but the slip resistance and stability are general, and it is not easy to carry. The gap with professional yoga brand is still better. Big, but winning at a high cost, as an entry-level device for beginners, you can still consider.</p>
<p>To purchase a more portable yoga mat, Decathlon‚Äôs 1.5mm travel rubber mat is a good choice, natural rubber material, good anti-slip performance, light and portable, the price is much cheaper than other brands of rubber mats.</p>
<p>In general, except for a few portable yoga mats, the thickness of the yoga mat is between 3-8mm, and products over 10mm are strictly not in the category of yoga mats. Decathlon automatically divides the 10mm mat into a fitness mat.</p>
